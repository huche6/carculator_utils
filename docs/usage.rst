Using Carculator
================

Static vs. Stochastic mode
--------------------------

.. note::

    Many examples are given in this :download:`example notebook </_static/resources/examples.zip>` that you can run directly on your computer.

The inventories can be calculated using the most likely value of the given input parameters ("static" mode), but also using
randomly-generated values based on a probability distribution for those ("stochastic" mode).

For example, the drivetrain efficiency of SUVs in 2020, regardless of the powertrain, is given the most likely value (i.e., the mode) of 0.38,
but with a triangular probability distribution with a minimum and maximum of 0.3 and 0.4, respectively.

Creating car models in static mode will use the most likely value of the given parameters to dimension the cars, etc., such as:

.. code-block:: python

   from carculator import *

   cip = CarInputParameters()
   cip.static()
   dcts, array = fill_xarray_from_input_parameters(cip)
   cm = CarModel(array)
   cm.set_all()


Alternatively, if one wishes to work with probability distributions as parameter values instead:

.. code-block:: python

    from carculator import *

    cip = CarInputParameters()
    cip.stochastic(800)
    dcts, array = fill_xarray_from_input_parameters(cip)
    cm = CarModel(array)
    cm.set_all()


This effectively creates 800 iterations of the same car models, picking pseudo-random value for the given parameters,
within the probability distributions defined. This allows to assess later the effect of uncertainty propagation on
characterized results.

In both case, a CarModel object is returned, with a 4-dimensional array `array` to store the generated parameters values, with the following dimensions:

0. Vehicle sizes (called "size"):
    * Mini
    * Small
    * Lower medium
    * Medium
    * Large
    * SUV
    * Van

1. Powertrains:
    * ICEV-p, ICEV-d, ICEV-g: vehicles with internal combustion engines running on gasoline, diesel and compressed gas, respectively.
    * HEV-p, HEV-d: vehicles with internal combustion engines running on gasoline and diesel, assisted with an electric engine.
    * PHEV-p, PHEV-d: vehicles with internal combustion engines running on gasoline and diesel, assisted with a plugin electric engine.
    * BEV: battery electric vehicles.
    * FCEV: fuel cell electric vehicles.

2. Year. Anything between 2000 and 2050.

3. Iteration number (length = 1 if static(), otherwise length = number of iterations).


:meth:`cm.set_all()` generates a CarModel object and calculates the energy consumption, components mass, as well as
exhaust and non-exhaust emissions for all vehicle profiles.


Custom values for given parameters
----------------------------------

You can pass your own values for the given parameters, effectively overriding the default values.

For example, you may think that the *base mass of the glider* for large diesel and petrol cars is 1600 kg in 2020
and 1,500 kg in 2040, and not 1,500 kg as defined by the default values. It is easy to change this value.
You need to create first a dictionary and define your new values as well as a probability distribution if needed :

.. code-block:: python

    dic_param = {
        ("Glider", ["ICEV-d", "ICEV-p"], "Large", "glider base mass", "triangular"): {
            (2020, "loc"): 1600.0,
            (2020, "minimum"): 1500.0,
            (2020, "maximum"): 2000.0,
            (2040, "loc"): 1500.0,
            (2040, "minimum"): 1300.0,
            (2040, "maximum"): 1700.0,
        }
    }

Then, you simply pass this dictionary to `modify_xarray_from_custom_parameters(<dic_param or filepath>, array)`, like so:

.. code-block:: python

    cip = CarInputParameters()
    cip.static()
    dcts, array = fill_xarray_from_input_parameters(cip)
    modify_xarray_from_custom_parameters(dic_param, array)
    cm = CarModel(array, cycle="WLTC")
    cm.set_all()

Alternatively, instead of a Python dictionary, you can pass a file path pointing to an Excel spreadsheet that contains
the values to change, following :download:`this template </_static/resources/template_workbook.zip>`.

The following probability distributions are accepted:
* "triangular"
* "lognormal"
* "normal"
* "uniform"
* "none"

Inter and extrapolation of parameters
-------------------------------------

``carculator`` creates by default car models for the year 2000, 2010, 2020 and 2040.
It is possible to inter and extrapolate all the parameters to other years simply by writing:

.. code-block:: python

    array = array.interp(
        year=[2018, 2022, 2035, 2040, 2045, 2050], kwargs={"fill_value": "extrapolate"}
    )

However, we do not recommend extrapolating for years before 2000 or beyond 2050.

Changing the driving cycle
--------------------------

``carculator`` gives the user the possibility to choose between several driving cycles. Driving cycles are determinant in
many aspects of the car model: hot pollutant emissions, noise emissions, tank-to-wheel energy, etc. Hence, each driving
cycle leads to slightly different results. By default, if no driving cycle is specified, the WLTC driving cycle is used.
To specify a driving cycle, simply do:

.. code-block:: python

    cip = CarInputParameters()
    cip.static()
    dcts, array = fill_xarray_from_input_parameters(cip)
    cm = CarModel(array, cycle="WLTC 3.4")
    cm.set_all()

In this case, the driving cycle *WLTC 3.4* is chosen (this driving cycle is in fact a sub-part of the WLTC driving cycle,
mostly concerned with driving on the motorway at speeds above 80 km/h). Driving cycles currently available:

* WLTC
* WLTC 3.1
* WLTC 3.2
* WLTC 3.3
* WLTC 3.4
* CADC Urban
* CADC Road
* CADC Motorway
* CADC Motorway 130
* CADC
* NEDC

The user can also create custom driving cycles and pass it to the :class:`CarModel` class:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np

    x = np.linspace(1, 1000)


    def f(x):
        return np.sin(x) + np.random.normal(scale=20, size=len(x)) + 70


    cycle = f(x)
    cm = CarModel(array, cycle=cycle)

Accessing calculated parameters of the car model
------------------------------------------------
Hence, the tank-to-wheel energy requirement per km driven per powertrain technology for a SUV in 2020 can be obtained
from the CarModel object:

.. code-block:: python

    TtW_energy = (
        cm.array.sel(size="SUV", year=2020, parameter="TtW energy", value=0)
        * 1
        / 3600
        * 100
    )

    plt.bar(TtW_energy.powertrain, TtW_energy)
    plt.ylabel("kWh/100 km")
    plt.show()

.. image:: /_static/img/fig_kwh_100km.png
    :width: 400
    :align: center
    :alt: Alternative text

.. note::
    If you call the :meth:`stochastic` method of the :class:`CarInputParameters`, you would have several values stored for a given calculated parameter
    in the array. The number of values correspond to the number of iterations you passed to :meth:`stochastic`.

For example, if you ran the model in stochastic mode with 800 iterations as shown in the section above, instead of one
value for the tank-to-wheel energy, you would have a distribution of values:

.. code-block:: python

    l_powertrains = TtW_energy.powertrain
    [plt.hist(e, bins=50, alpha=0.8, label=e.powertrain.values) for e in TtW_energy]
    plt.ylabel("kWh/100 km")
    plt.legend()

.. image:: /_static/img/stochastic_example_ttw.png
    :width: 400
    :align: center
    :alt: Alternative text

Any other attributes of the CarModel class can be obtained in a similar way.
Hence, the following code lists all direct exhaust emissions included in the inventory of an petrol Van in 2020:

List of all the given and calculated parameters of the car model:

.. code-block:: python

    list_param = cm.array.coords["parameter"].values.tolist()

Return the parameters concerned with direct exhaust emissions (we remove noise emissions):

.. code-block:: python

    direct_emissions = [x for x in list_param if "emission" in x and "noise" not in x]

Finally, return their values and display the first 10 in a table:

.. code-block:: python

    cm.array.sel(
        parameter=direct_emissions, year=2020, size="Van", powertrain="BEV"
    ).to_dataframe(name="direct emissions")

Or we could be interested in visualizing the distribution of non-characterized noise emissions, in joules:

.. code-block:: python

    noise_emissions = [x for x in list_param if "noise" in x]
    data = cm.array.sel(
        parameter=noise_emissions, year=2020, size="Van", powertrain="ICEV-p", value=0
    ).to_dataframe(name="noise emissions")["noise emissions"]
    data[data > 0].plot(kind="bar")
    plt.ylabel("joules per km")

.. image:: /_static/img/example_noise_emissions.png
    :width: 400
    :align: center
    :alt: Alternative text

Modify calculated parameters
----------------------------

As input parameters, calculated parameters can also be overridden. For example here, we override the `driving mass`
of large diesel vehicles for 2010 and 2020:

.. code-block:: python

    cm.array.loc["Large", "ICEV-d", "driving mass", [2010, 2020]] = [[2000], [2200]]

Characterization of inventories (static)
----------------------------------------

``carculator`` makes the characterization of inventories easy. You can characterize the inventories directly from
``carculator`` against midpoint impact assessment methods.

For example, to obtain characterized results against the midpoint impact assessment method ReCiPe for all cars:

.. code-block:: python

    ic = InventoryCalculation(cm)
    results = ic.calculate_impacts()


Hence, to plot the carbon footprint for all medium cars in 2020:

.. code-block:: python

    results.sel(
        size="Medium", year=2020, impact_category="climate change", value=0
    ).to_dataframe("impact").unstack(level=1)["impact"].plot(kind="bar", stacked=True)
    plt.ylabel("kg CO2-eq./vkm")
    plt.show()

.. image:: /_static/img/example_carbon_footprint.png
    :width: 400
    :align: center
    :alt: Alternative text

.. note::
    For now, only the ReCiPe method is available for midpoint characterization. Also, once the instance of the :class:`CarModel`
    class has been created, there is no need to re-create it in order to calculate additional environmental impacts (unless you wish to
    change values of certain input or calculated parameters, the driving cycle or go from static to stochastic mode).

Characterization of inventories (stochastic)
--------------------------------------------

In the same manner, you can obtain distributions of results, instead of one-point values if you have run the model in
stochastic mode (with 500 iterations and the driving cycle WLTC).

.. code-block:: python

    cip = CarInputParameters()
    cip.stochastic(500)
    dcts, array = fill_xarray_from_input_parameters(cip)
    cm = CarModel(array, cycle="WLTC")
    cm.set_all()
    scope = {
        "powertrain": ["BEV", "PHEV"],
    }
    ic = InventoryCalculation(cm, scope=scope)

    results = ic.calculate_impacts()

    data_MC = (
        results.sel(impact_category="climate change")
        .sum(axis=3)
        .to_dataframe("climate change")
    )
    plt.style.use("seaborn")
    data_MC.unstack(level=[0, 1, 2]).boxplot(showfliers=False, figsize=(20, 5))
    plt.xticks(rotation=70)
    plt.ylabel("kg CO2-eq./vkm")

Many other examples are described in a Jupyter Notebook in the ``examples`` folder.

Export of inventories (static)
------------------------------

Inventories can be exported as:
    * a Python list of exchanges
    * a Brightway2 bw2io.importers.base_lci.LCIImporter object, ready to be imported in a Brigthway2 environment
    * an Excel file, to be imported in a Brigthway2 environment
    * a CSV file, to be imported in SimaPro 9.x.

.. code-block:: python

    ic = InventoryCalculation(cm)

    # export the inventories as a Python list
    mylist = ic.export_lci()
    # export the inventories as a Brightway2 object
    import_object = ic.export_lci_to_bw()
    # export the inventories as an Excel file (returns the file path of the created file)
    filepath = ic.export_lci_to_excel(
        software_compatibility="brightway2", ecoinvent_version="3.7"
    )
    filepath = ic.export_lci_to_excel(
        software_compatibility="simapro", ecoinvent_version="3.6"
    )

Export of inventories (stochastic)
----------------------------------

If you had run the model in stochastic mode, the export functions return in addition an array that contains pre-sampled values
for each parameter of each car, in order to perform Monte Carlo analyses in Brightway2.

.. code-block:: python

    ic = InventoryCalculation(cm)

    # export the inventories as a Python list
    mylist, presamples_arr = ic.export_lci()
    # export the inventories as a Brightway2 object
    import_object, presamples_arr = ic.export_lci_to_bw()
    # export the inventories as an Excel file (note that this method does not return the presamples array)
    filepath = ic.export_lci_to_excel()

Import of inventories (static)
------------------------------

The background inventory is originally a combination between ecoinvent 3.6 and outputs from PIK's REMIND model.
Outputs from PIK's REMIND are used to project expected progress in different sectors into ecoinvent. For example, the efficiency
of electricity-producing technologies as well as the electricity mixes in the future for the main world regions
are built upon REMIND outputs.
The library used to create hybrid versions of the ecoinvent database from PIK's REMIND is called
`premise <https://github.com/romainsacchi/premise>`_.
This means that, as it is, the inventory cannot properly link to ecoinvent 3.6 or 3.7 unless some transformation is performed
before. These transformations are in fact performed when exporting the inventory. Hence, when doing:

.. code-block:: python

    ic.export_lci_to_excel(ecoinvent_compatibility=True, ecoinvent_version="3.6")

the resulting inventory should properly link to the unmodified version of ecoinvent 3.6 cutoff.
Should you wish to export an inventory to link with a IAM-modified version of ecoinvent,
just export the inventory with the `ecoinvent_compatibility` argument set to `False`.

.. code-block:: python

    ic.export_lci_to_excel(ecoinvent_compatibility=False, ecoinvent_version="3.6")

In that case, the inventory will only link to a custom ecoinvent database produced by `premise`.

But in any case, the following script should successfully import the inventory into a Brightway2 project:

.. code-block:: python

    import brightway2 as bw

    bw.projects.set_current("test_carculator")
    import bw2io

    fp = r"C:\file_path_to_the_inventory\lci-test.xlsx"

    i = bw2io.ExcelImporter(fp)
    i.apply_strategies()

    i.match_database(
        "name_of_the_ecoinvent_db", fields=("name", "unit", "location", "reference product")
    )
    i.match_database("biosphere3", fields=("name", "unit", "categories"))
    i.match_database("additional_biosphere", fields=("name", "unit", "categories"))
    i.match_database(fields=("name", "unit", "location"))

    i.statistics()

    # if there are some unlinked left
    i.add_unlinked_flows_to_biosphere_database()

    i.write_database()
